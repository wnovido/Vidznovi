	I love capturing the beauty of God's creation, may it be in the form of people or nature.<br><br>

	One of the moments I'd love to capture is event.  I get to see the emotions of each person.  There's so much joy for me to be able to get that moment using my lens.  I treat my lens as my very own set of eyes.  Through my lens, it gives me the opportunity to show how I view the beauty of the world that surrounds me.  The world is filled with so much beauty, that I wished I could capture them all.<br><br>

	My favorite subject are my kids.  For me they're the best gift I ever have.  I'm so thankful that I had an opportunity to be able to spend my time with them.  I want to document every single bit of them.  May it be a special occasion or just a regular play.... I recognize that life is too short, and I want to make the most out of it.  I want the world to see how I see the world through my photos.<br><br>

	How did it all started?<br><br>

	I've been in love in capturing special moments since I was younger.  I always carry with me a handy cam.  Back then I was still using a film.  It was a Pentax camera with manual rotary timer.  It broke prior to my wedding day.  I replaced it with a Minolta film camera.  Then with many many more versions of film camera.  Until before I give birth to Janelle that you can hardly get a film camera from the store.  The photo industry decided to replace the market with digital camera.  I both my first digital camera before giving birth to Janelle.  At the hospital, since I'm not used to using digital, all of the images that I capture of Janelle was mostly blurry or grainy.  I'm like..."Ok, I think I don't want to miss Janelle's milestone with this hand held camera.... I need to purchase an SLR camera"  and that's what I did.  I took couple of shoot here and couple of shoot there.  And there are times that I'll bring Janelle to Southpoint at JC Penny or Picture people to have her photo taken.   I can easily pay Picture people $600 for one sitting simply because I would order all of Janelle's shots and some in different sizes to distribute with our relatives back home.  However, the sense of my satisfaction with the result of the studio photos of Janelle is not there.

	As a result, I took classes, explore more in the field of photography.  I bought various equipments, and yes, you can say that I have build my very own home photo studio.  I bought and read various photography books.  I purchased different hardwares, storage and softwares.   It just build up.  At first, it was a hobby.  Now, it's what I call a history!
